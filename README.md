## The Background
     
The fight between SSJ2 Gohan and Cell is the climax of the Cell Saga, which spans from episodes 125 to 194 of the anime. The saga follows the Z Fighters as they face the threat of the androids and Cell, a bio-engineered creature that can absorb other beings and increase his power. Cell's ultimate goal is to achieve his perfect form by absorbing Androids 17 and 18, and then challenge the strongest fighters on Earth to a tournament called the Cell Games.
     
After achieving his perfect form, Cell announces the Cell Games to the world and gives the Z Fighters ten days to prepare. During this time, Goku and Gohan train in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, where they master the Super Saiyan form and learn to maintain it without losing energy. Goku also senses that Gohan has a hidden potential that surpasses his own, and hopes that he can unleash it during the fight with Cell.
     
## The Fight
     
The Cell Games begin with Goku as the first challenger. He fights evenly with Cell for a while, but soon realizes that he is no match for him. He then surprises everyone by forfeiting the match and nominating Gohan as his successor. Goku believes that Gohan has the power to defeat Cell, but he also knows that Gohan is not a fighter by nature and does not enjoy killing. He hopes that by pushing him to his limit, he can awaken his latent power and make him overcome his hesitation.
     
Gohan reluctantly agrees to fight Cell, but he is clearly outmatched by him. Cell notices that Gohan is holding back his true strength, and decides to provoke him by creating seven smaller versions of himself called the Cell Juniors. He orders them to attack the other Z Fighters, who are helpless against them. He also tortures Android 16, who was previously an enemy but later became an ally of the Z Fighters. He rips off his head and crushes it in front of Gohan, destroying his only chance of being revived by the Dragon Balls.

Gohan watches in horror as his friends and family are being beaten by the Cell Juniors. He feels a surge of anger and pain that triggers his transformation into a Super Saiyan 2, a level beyond the Super Saiyan. His hair becomes spikier and stands up, his eyes turn green, and his aura crackles with electricity. He also gains a tremendous boost in power, speed, and confidence.
     
Gohan then proceeds to annihilate the Cell Juniors with ease, shocking everyone with his new power. He kills them one by one with punches, kicks, blasts, and even a headbutt. He does not show any mercy or remorse, as he is consumed by his rage. He then turns his attention to Cell, who is terrified by Gohan's transformation. He challenges him to a final showdown, promising to make him pay for what he has done.
     
## The Conclusion
     
The first part of the fight between SSJ2 Gohan and Cell ends with Gohan having the upper hand over Cell. He has shown his true potential and surpassed everyone's expectations. However, the fight is far from over, as Cell still has some tricks up his sleeve. The second part of the fight will be covered in another article.
